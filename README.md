# Malware-Analysis
The term malware is a contraction of malicious software. Put simply, malware is any piece of software that was written with the intent of doing harm to data, devices or to people. 
Malware Analysis is the process of figuring out as much as possible in a safe environment, what a malware sample does, so that the general public can be notified of its danger and the crysis be averted. 

Presented here are a list of executive reports furnished from analysis being done on malware samples. The list will be updated as more samples are analysed.
